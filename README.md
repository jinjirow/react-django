# Unchained

Example of how you can create a React app that uses the Django framework for its backend.

# Usage:

-Install dependencies and build React app

    npm install

    npm run build

Run web server as you would with any Django project:

    python manage.py runserver


Note: This project uses python 3
You will also need to provide a secret key for the Django app
I kept mine locally in a file named params.py you will see that
referenced in settings.py.
